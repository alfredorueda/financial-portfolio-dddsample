# Stock Portfolio API Specification

## 1. USER STORIES

### 1.1 Buy Stocks User Story
**As an** investor with a portfolio  
**I want to** purchase shares of a specific stock by simply providing the ticker symbol and quantity  
**So that** I can build my investment portfolio without needing to manually research current market prices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I must have sufficient funds in my portfolio balance to cover the total purchase amount
- I only need to specify the stock ticker symbol and the desired quantity of shares
- The system will automatically fetch the current market price for the specified stock
- The system validates that both the quantity is positive and the fetched price is valid
- If validation fails or I have insufficient funds, the operation is rejected with a clear error message
- Upon success, the system:
  - Creates a new "lot" recording the purchase details (quantity, price, date)
  - Adds this lot to my existing holding of this stock (or creates a new holding if this is my first purchase)
  - Deducts the total cost from my portfolio's cash balance
  - Records a PURCHASE transaction in my transaction history
  - Returns a confirmation of the successful purchase

### 1.2 Sell Stocks User Story
**As an** investor with existing stock holdings  
**I want to** sell shares of a specific stock by simply providing the ticker symbol and quantity  
**So that** I can realize profits, cut losses, or rebalance my portfolio based on current market conditions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I must have sufficient shares of the specified stock in my holdings
- I only need to specify the stock ticker symbol and the quantity I wish to sell
- The system will automatically fetch the current market price for the specified stock
- The system validates that both the quantity is positive and the fetched price is valid
- If validation fails or I have insufficient shares, the operation is rejected with a clear error message
- Upon success, the system:
  - Sells shares using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) accounting method (oldest shares are sold first)
  - Calculates the cost basis of the sold shares based on their original purchase prices
  - Calculates the proceeds (quantity Ã— current price) and profit/loss (proceeds - cost basis)
  - Increases my portfolio's cash balance by the proceeds amount
  - Records a SALE transaction in my transaction history, including the profit/loss information
  - Removes the sold shares from my holdings (and removes the holding entirely if all shares are sold)

**Explanation:**
This endpoint allows an investor to purchase shares of a stock by specifying just the ticker symbol and quantity. The system automatically fetches the current market price, verifies that the portfolio has sufficient funds, executes the purchase, creates a new lot in the appropriate holding, and updates the portfolio's cash balance. The portfolio ID is specified in the path, while the ticker and quantity are passed in the request body. The endpoint returns a 200 OK response on success with no specific content, or appropriate error responses when the operation fails.

## 6. SUGGESTED FUTURE EVOLUTIONS

### 6.1 Portfolio Performance Analysis
Implement additional metrics and endpoints to enhance the existing performance analysis:
- Day-to-day change in portfolio value
- Sector-based diversification analysis
- Performance comparison with market benchmarks
- Risk metrics (beta, volatility)
- Portfolio allocation visualization

### 6.2 Tax Reporting
Develop functionality to generate tax reports for investment activity:
- Annual realized gains/losses report
- Long-term vs. short-term capital gains classification
- Tax lot optimization strategies (beyond simple FIFO)
- Export capabilities for tax preparation software

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES AND DEVIATIONS

### 7.1 Automated Stock Price Fetching
The current implementation automatically fetches stock prices at the time of transaction, rather than requiring clients to provide prices. This approach has several implications:

- **Advantages**:
  - Simplifies the client API by requiring fewer parameters
  - Ensures all transactions use legitimate market prices
  - Prevents price manipulation by clients

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Creates a dependency on the stock price service
  - Makes historical testing more difficult
  - May cause issues if the price service is unavailable

### 7.2 REST Design Considerations

The current API follows a resource-oriented design with some notable characteristics:

- **Collection Resources**:
  - Uses noun-based endpoints for collections (`/purchases`, `/sales`, `/deposits`, `/withdrawals`)
  - Each collection is properly nested under its parent portfolio resource

- **HTTP Status Codes**:
  - Returns 200 OK for successful operations rather than 201 Created for new resources
  - Uses appropriate error codes (404, 409) for different failure conditions

- **Potential Improvements**:
  - Consider using PUT for idempotent operations
  - Return 201 Created with a location header for resource creation operations
  - Include more detailed responses for successful operations

### 7.3 Transaction Recording

The system maintains a comprehensive transaction history for all financial operations:

- Each deposit, withdrawal, purchase, and sale is recorded as a Transaction
- Transactions are immutable records of the financial history
- The transaction history can be filtered and queried through the API

This approach provides full auditability and supports detailed reporting, but requires careful database design to handle potentially large transaction volumes efficiently.
