## 🎯 The Importance of Ubiquitous Language in DDD

In **Domain-Driven Design**, using clear and precise terminology is not just a naming exercise—it's an essential design discipline.

- ✅ Promotes shared understanding between domain experts and developers.
- ✅ Makes the code self-documenting and easier to maintain.
- ✅ Aligns software with real-world business logic.
